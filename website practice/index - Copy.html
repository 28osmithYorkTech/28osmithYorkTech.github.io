<h1 class="head"> Hello! welcome to my website!</h1>
<h2 class="subhead">Here you can find tips and tricks from my favorite games!</h2>

<p> Games are a very fun pastime, whether they are video games, board games, or card games. I don't have too many games, but the ones I have/play are a variety of popular games and not very well known games. 
    I will share the games I play, my opinions on them, and tips and/or tricks in each of the games. I will also share the games I have for my console... </p>
