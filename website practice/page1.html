<p> Board Games are very fun to play. You are immersed in the game when you move your piece and in most games, shows where you're going.

    <p>I am a very big fan of Ticket To Ride. Although most people I talk to have no clue what it is, as of 2024, 18 MILLION copies have been sold from when it started in 2004. That's
       900,000 games sold each year! And unlike a standard board game, you can get multiple different maps. I prefer the main maps where you play in a different country (or Pennsylvania, that's a 
       main map) and not the First Journeys or Rails and Sails. But the main drawback is only a couple boards have the train cars and takes maybe 1 1/2 hours to play. 15 for setup, 1 hour for play, 
       and 15 for cleanup. </p>
